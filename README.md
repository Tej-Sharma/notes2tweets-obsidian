# Notes2Tweets

Generate and schedule tweets automatically from your notes. Use Obsidian like you normally do and press 1 button to convert your notes into tweets.

Writing a lot and feel like sharing it with the rest of the world? Too busy or too lazy to write a tweet? I was struggling with this myself and wanted to share all my learnings with the world automagically, so I built this. Hope it's useful to you as well.

## Setup

1. Install the plugin
2. Go to the settings -> Notes 2 Tweets -> Set your API keys
3. [Optional] If you don't want to set up OpenAI and Twitter APIs yourself, you can purchase a license for the plugin to handle this for you (this is because these APIs cost a lot of money to use and I can't afford to pay for everyone's usage)
4. Open the Twitter logo in the left sidebar
5. Boom! Press generate and schedule the ones you like
