# Notes2Tweets

Writing a lot and feel like sharing it with the rest of the world? Too busy or too lazy to write a tweet? I was struggling with time so I built this tool to convert everything I write in Obsidan

Use the button on the sidebar on the left (the Twitter logo), enter your OpenAI key, and boom, what it will do is all the notes you took since the last sync, it will convert them into tweets and display them to you.
